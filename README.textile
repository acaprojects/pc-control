h2. Additional Notes

* Possibly this would work better as a Windows service (at the moment a user needs to be logged in) although then there are probably a host of other issues when it comes to launching apps on the desktop?
* It could use a design overhaul, C# is not my preferred programming language it just had the lowest barrier to entry
* It requires a copy of @makecert.exe@ either in the directory or PATH for generating TLS keys on first run
* Depends on http://directshownet.sourceforge.net/ and http://json.codeplex.com/
